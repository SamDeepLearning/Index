An index of past and current projects, ranked by last code commit.

Last code commit does not count non-code changes and correlates strongly with project health (alive --> dead). 

<br>
**alive**: in development  
**finished**: project goals met, implies usability & death  
**usable**: project is useful/runnable  
**dead**: no further development planned
