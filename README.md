This is an index of past and current projects, ranked by *last code commit*. 

*Last code commit* implies that a commit with no code - be it artwork, design, or documentation - is not counted.

If a project is alive, it might take 30 seconds to download but it will run - first try.

<br>
**alive**: in development  
**finished**: project goals met, implies usability & death  
**usable**: project is useful/runnable  
**dead**: no further development planned
