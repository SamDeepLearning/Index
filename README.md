This is an index of past and current projects, ordered by last code commit, meaning artwork, design, or documentation updates aren't reflected here.

If a project is alive, follow the README and take 30 seconds to run it. If it doesn't run, I'll buy you a coke.

<br>
**alive**: in development  
**finished**: project goals met, implies usability & death  
**usable**: project is useful/runnable  
**dead**: no further development planned
