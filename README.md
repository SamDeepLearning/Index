This is an index of past and current projects, ordered by last code commit, i.e. not artwork, design, or documentation.

If a project is alive, take 30 seconds to follow the README and run it. If it doesn't run, I'll buy you a coke.

<br>
**alive**: in development  
**finished**: project goals met, implies usability & death  
**usable**: project is useful/runnable  
**dead**: no further development planned
